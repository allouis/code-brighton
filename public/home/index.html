				<h1>What is it?</h1>
				<p>Code and Chips is a free scavenger hunt around unusual locations in Brighton. Take part to discover new places and find out a little bit about coding along the way. It is brought to you by Codebar, an organisation that nurtures diversity in the coding community.
				</p>
				<h1>Who is it for?</h1>
				
				<p>If you are a complete coding newbie that's great - the challenge is designed so that anyone can take part, no coding knowledge required! If you are a coding expert, get involved anyway and find out what Codebar is about.
				<br>This event is open to women, LGBTQ and others under represented in the tech community over the ages of 18.
				</p>
				<h1>How do I get started?</h1>
				<p>You need a smartphone with location services. To unlock the challenges go to the locations below - the chips will direct your phone to facts and challenges created by Codebar students. </p>
