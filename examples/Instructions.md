# What are we doing (as students)?
We are creating a digialt scavenger hunt throughout Brighton and Hove where students create websites that are unlocked at specific locations by reading RFID chips and QR codes that launch your specific website with a specific "short URL"

# What sort of website? 
We are providing you with a few suggestions of the types of info you may want to display, but the overall theme is to uncover the digital side of Brighton. 

- [General Template](https://github.com/codebar/code-brighton/tree/master/examples/general)
- [Persona Template](https://github.com/codebar/code-brighton/tree/master/examples/personas)
- [Factual Template](https://github.com/codebar/code-brighton/tree/master/examples/factual)
- [Location Image Gallery](https://github.com/codebar/code-brighton/tree/master/examples/location-gallery)

We are also providing a few examples that have a specific header and footer that will be consistent across all sites.
## Theme ideas

# How are we presenting this to the public?
Code and Chips is a free scavenger hunt around unusual locations in Brighton. Take part to discover new places and find out a little bit about coding along the way. It is brought to you by Codebar, an organisation that nurtures diversity in the coding community.

This is your moment to say, "I made that"
