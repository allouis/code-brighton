        <li>If all teams were diverse the future of innovation could perform at twice the rate</li>
        <li>Gender diverse teams perform better</li>
        <li>Tech has a huge influence on way we live our lives. --  We need under represented people to have equal influence in shaping the future</li>

        <li>Share coding knowledge with people underrepresented in tech</li>
        <li>Recognise bias</li>
        <li>Have confidence - you can learn to write code, don't let anyone make you think otherwise!</li>
        <li>Build stuff at codebar and tell people about it!</li>
        <li>Companies to implement flexible working hours</li>
        <li>Companies to implement longer paternity leave</li>
        <li>If someone displays derogatory behaviour make sure you call them out on it</li>
        <li>If someone under-represented tells you that they thought your behaviour was inappropriate listen to them and thank them for explaining</li>

      <h1>What is this?</h1>
      <p>Code and Chips is a free scavenger hunt around unusual locations in Brighton. Take part to discover new places and find out a little bit about coding along the way. It is brought to you by Codebar, an organisation that nurtures diversity in the coding community.

      <h1>What is Codebar?</h1>
      <h3>codebar is a non-profit initiative that facilitates the growth of a diverse tech community by running regular programming workshops.</h3>
      <p>Our goal is to enable underrepresented groups to learn programming in a safe and collaborative environment and expand their career opportunities. To achieve this, we run free weekly workshops in Brighton, regular events and try to create opportunities for our students making technology and coding more accessible.</p>
